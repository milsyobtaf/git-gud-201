The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.

You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!

You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Look, last night was a mistake. Take me to your leader! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!
