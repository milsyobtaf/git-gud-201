# I had more, but you go ahead.

Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Do a flip! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Daylight and everything. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

Ow, my spirit! Daddy Bender, we're hungry. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! But I know you in the future. __I cleaned your poop.__ *But I've never been to the moon!* Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

## Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Why would I want to know that? Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! What kind of a father would I be if I said no?

1. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
2. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.
3. Okay, I like a challenge.
